  /*
  * 1. Create a function called fibonacciSequence which receive 1 integer parameter (The position in the fibonacci sequence)
  * 2. The idea of this function is to return the number in the fibonacci sequence
  * The fibonacci sequence is the series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers
  * Example 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,etc
  *
  * Tests:
  * 1. fibonacciSequence(5) -> 3
  * 2. fibonacciSequence(8) -> 13
  * 3. fibonacciSequence(16) -> 610
  *
  * Extra Small Challenge if you want:
  * Iterate from 1 to 20 and find the number in each of the positions of the fibonacci sequence
